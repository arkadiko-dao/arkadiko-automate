# Arkadiko Automate
https://www.arkadiko.finance/

Smart Contract Automation simplified, like IFTTT model (If This Happens, Then Execute That).

Execute actions based on certain events
- Block Height or Block Height Interval
- Based on Oracle/AMM data (if price drops/goes over, do X)
- Custom on-chain activity (if address X sends STX)
- Block Number

## Examples

1. Every 524 blocks, harvest ALEX farming rewards and sell for STX/USDA/â€¦
2. Whenever atALEX goes under the ALEX/atALEX ratio, buy atALEX
3. When the price of USDA goes under 75 cents, buy X STX
4. When a Megapont Ape drops under 2000 STX, buy it
5. Every 1008 blocks, add DIKO rewards to liquidation pool
6. Bid (X%) higher on Gamma when I no longer have the highest bid
7. Arbitrage?
